# IdleExpanse
Idle space simulation web application. Will have micromanagement with a veriety of layers (Galaxy -> Star Systems -> Planets -> Moons? (Maybe))

## Why am I making this?
Because I have had this idea for a while space is something I am deeply captivated by and making a simulation type game in theory seems like an enjoyable idea to me. I also want a better understanding of front and back end development. I hope to learn some TypeScript and implement my Python skills into this project.

## ToDo
- Research Django API creation
- Research React and how to implement front end of application
- Make a design prototype in Figma

## Packages
- django
- djangorestframework
